  This example illustrates a simple use of GPIO with Ultibo on Raspberry Pi to blink a LED.

  Make sure to connect the LED to RPi physical pin #16 (GPIO pin 23), please take a look at the accompanying diagram and photo.
  
  The example has been created for a Raspberry Pi 2 but will also run on a Raspberry Pi 3.
  
  To convert this example to Raspberry Pi A/B/A+/B+/Zero create a new project then copy and
  paste this code into it taking care to adjust the RaspberryPi2 unit in the uses clause as
  required.
